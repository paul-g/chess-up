chess-up
========

A simplistic chess interface I built as holiday project.

## Requires

1. g++ >= 4.8

2. [SDL libray](https://www.libsdl.org/) including TrueType font
and image extensions (adjust for your distribution):

`sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-image-dev`

3. GNU Make

## Running

`make run`
